    I'm currently working for Middlestate, LLC - a design company in Visalia,
    CA. Due to the pandemic and the demand for e-commerce, I've learned Shopify
    theme development and am looking to get hired as a Shopify Developer.

            This project was a completed website that was handed to me to revamp
            the homepage using a new layout and new content.

            I learned about Jade and Pug, their similarities compared to HTML
            and CSS, and also how to work with another developers' code.

            This website was originally a PSD to HTML project that I developed.
            I later rebuilt it using Netlify & Gatsby. Doing this, I was able to
            increase the speed of the website from 32% (according to Google
            PageSpeed Insights) to 66% for mobile and from 92% to 94% for
            desktop, while also enabling the client to publish changes to the
            sites' content using Netlify's CMS dashboard. I'm continuing to make
            improvements to the performance of the site, as well as other areas.

            This is a rebuild for a website that was originally built using
            WordPress. That website can visited at http://dataharvest.co/.  I
            developed the rebuild using NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, Sass, and GraphQL.
            The website for the rebuild is linked below (along with the link to
            the GitHub code) and is expected to launch soon.
