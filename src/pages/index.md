            This project was a completed website that was handed to me to revamp
            the homepage layout and include updated content. I learned about
            Jade and Pug, their similarities compared to HTML and CSS, and also
            how to work with another developers' code.

            This was a website I originally coded using HTML, CSS, and some
            JavaScript. Per clients' request, I later rebuilt it using
            NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, Sass, and GraphQL in order for the client to be
            able to edit the sites' content using the CMS dashboard. I was also
            able to integrate the clients' Google Calendar events into the
            website to display upcoming events and display uploaded PDF files
            with pagination functionality.
