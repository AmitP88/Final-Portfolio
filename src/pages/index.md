    I'm currently working for MiddleState, LLC - a design company in Visalia,
    CA. I'm also on the job hunt and looking to take my skills to the next
    level. I enjoy building React projects, working with JavaScript, and
    creating UIs that look interesting. Let's build something awesome.

            This project was a completed website that was handed to me to revamp
            the homepage layout and include updated content. I learned about
            Jade and Pug, their similarities compared to HTML and CSS, and also
            how to work with another developers' code.

            This website was originally a PSD to HTML project that I developed.
            I later rebuilt it using Netlify & Gatsby. Doing this, I was able to
            increase the speed of the website from 32% (according to Google
            PageSpeed Insights) to 66%, while also enabling the client to
            publish changes to the sites' content using Netlify's CMS dashboard.


            The current live site (https://cellardoor101.com) is the original
            PSD to HTML version of the project. To view the

            code for the live site version, please visit
            https://github.com/middlestate/CellarDoor . Linked below is the
            Netlify/Gatsby rebuild and is expected to launch soon.

            This is a rebuild for a website that was originally built using
            WordPress. That website can visited at http://dataharvest.co/.  I
            developed the rebuild using NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, Sass, and GraphQL.
            The website for the rebuild is linked below (along with the link to
            the GitHub code) and is expected to launch soon.
