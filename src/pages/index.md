    I'm currently working for Middlestate, LLC - a design company in Visalia,
    CA. I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Netlify and Gatsby, to
    develop websites for various businesses in the Central Valley. I've learned
    how to build Shopify themes from the ground up and am looking for a job as a
    Shopify theme developer.

    These are Shopify development stores that I've customized from downloaded
    free themes from the Shopify Theme store. Below is the process that I took
    to convert downloaded PSDs of e-commerce sites to Shopify sites, as well as
    installing and customizing required Shopify plugins. Below the process
    description are the actual Shopify store projects.

    These were the projects I did for Middlestate, LLC. These were contract jobs
    for which I also did periodic updates to add new content/features. The
    technologies that I used were mainly NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, and Sass.

            This project was a completed website that was handed to me to revamp
            the homepage using a new layout and new content.

            I learned about Jade and Pug, their similarities compared to HTML
            and CSS, and also how to work with another developers' code.

            This website was originally a PSD to HTML project that I developed.
            I later rebuilt it using Netlify & Gatsby. Doing this, I was able to
            increase the speed of the website from 32% (according to Google
            PageSpeed Insights) to 66% for mobile and from 92% to 94% for
            desktop, while also enabling the client to publish changes to the
            sites' content using Netlify's CMS dashboard. I'm continuing to make
            improvements to the performance of the site, as well as other areas.

            This is a rebuild for a website that was originally built using
            WordPress. That website can visited at http://dataharvest.co/.  I
            developed the rebuild using NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, Sass, and GraphQL.
            The website for the rebuild is linked below (along with the link to
            the GitHub code) and is expected to launch soon.
