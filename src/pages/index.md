    I've worked for Middlestate, LLC - a design company in Visalia, CA in 2019.
    I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Netlify and Gatsby, to develop
    websites for various businesses in the Central Valley. In 2020, I've learned
    how to build and customize Shopify themes and am looking for a job as a
    Shopify theme developer.

    These are Shopify development stores that I've built from scratch using
    downloaded free themes from the Shopify Theme store. Below is the process
    that I took to convert downloaded PSDs of e-commerce sites to Shopify sites,
    as well as installing and customizing required Shopify plugins. Below the
    process description are the actual Shopify store projects.

            Downloaded the Fashion Llorem e-commerce PSD mockup from
            https://colorlib.com/wp/free-psd-ecommerce-templates/ and added the
            free Shopify theme Brooklyn to my Shopify Admin. Customized the free
            theme's elements using HTML, CSS, JS to match the mockup. Also used
            Shopify Liquid to render store products. Also installed the
            following Shopify plugins into the site:  Auto Multi Currency
            Converter, Product Reviews, ShareThis Share Buttons, Wishlist Plus.
            Created custom sections and customized online content editor using
            Liquid Schemas.

    These were the projects I did for Middlestate, LLC. These were contract jobs
    for which I also did periodic updates to add new content/features. The
    technologies that I used were mainly NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, and Sass.

            This project was a completed website that was handed to me to revamp
            the homepage using a new layout and new content.

            I learned about Jade and Pug, their similarities compared to HTML
            and CSS, and also how to work with another developers' code.

            This website was originally a PSD to HTML project that I developed.
            I later rebuilt it using Netlify & Gatsby. Doing this, I was able to
            increase the speed of the website from 32% (according to Google
            PageSpeed Insights) to 66% for mobile and from 92% to 94% for
            desktop, while also enabling the client to publish changes to the
            sites' content using Netlify's CMS dashboard. 


            Due to the pandemic, the business remodeled their website to another
            contractor, so the new website can be viewed here:
            https://cellardoor101.com/. The netlify site is the one I built.

            This is a rebuild for a website that was originally built using
            WordPress. That website can visited at http://dataharvest.co/.  I
            developed the rebuild using NetlifyCMS, Gatsby, Sass, and GraphQL.
            The website for the rebuild is linked below (along with the link to
            the GitHub code).
